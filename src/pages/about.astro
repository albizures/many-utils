			<p>
				Many Utils was born out of frustration with the current state of online utility websites. We've all been there –
				you need a quick tool to shorten a URL, generate a password, or convert some units, and you end up on a page
				that's more ads than content, with a user interface that looks like it hasn't been updated since the early
				2000s.
			</p>
			<p>
				We believe that utility tools should be just that – useful. Not an exercise in avoiding pop-ups or deciphering
				cluttered layouts. That's why we created Many Utils, a clean, ad-free platform that puts functionality and user
				experience first.
			</p>
			<p>Our mission is simple:</p>
			<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 pl-6 space-y-2">
				<li>Provide a wide range of useful utilities in one place</li>
				<li>Offer a clean, intuitive interface that's a joy to use</li>
				<li>Ensure fast, efficient performance without the bloat</li>
				<li>Respect our users' privacy and avoid intrusive advertising</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Whether you're a developer looking for quick coding utilities, a student needing calculation tools, or just
				someone who appreciates well-designed, functional web apps, Many Utils is here for you. We're constantly adding
				new tools and improving existing ones based on user feedback.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for choosing Many Utils. We hope our tools make your online tasks a little bit easier and a lot more
				pleasant.
